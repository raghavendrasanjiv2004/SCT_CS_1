# Task 1 – Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

## Objective
To implement a Caesar Cipher program that encrypts and decrypts text using a user-defined shift value.

## Tools Used
Python 3
Description
The Caesar Cipher shifts each alphabetic character by a fixed number of positions. Encryption shifts characters forward, and decryption shifts them backward.

## How to Run
Run the file using: python caesar.py
Enter the message
Enter the shift value
Choose encrypt or decrypt
## Sample Output
Encryption: Yashu → Bdvkx

Decryption: Bdvkx → Yashu
